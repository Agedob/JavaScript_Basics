   	  	<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
   	  	<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be conncted to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
   	  <ul>
   	  	    <li>
   	  	    	<a href="">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All Java Script variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<span class="blue-text">var x;</span>
   	  	    </li>
   	  	    <li>
   	  	    	<a href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operations assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee pured in it, giving out variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span class="blue-text">var x = 10;</span>
   	  	    </li>
   	  	    <li>
   	  	    	<a href="">Data Types</a>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. there are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean -<span class="blue-text">true</span>or<span class="blue-text">false;</span>null -<span class="blue-text">null</span> aka nothing; Number -<span class="blue-text">42</span>or<span class="blue-text">3.14159;</span>String -<span class="blue-text">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array -<span class="blue-text">{1,'coding',2,'Dojo'];</span>and Object -<span class="blue-text"> {first_name: 'Jane',last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
   	  	    </li>
   	  	    <li>
   	  	    	<a href="">Conditionals</a>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to acomplish this. There are the following conditional statements:<span class="blue-text">if</span>a specified condition is ture, do this in our code block;<span class="blue-text">else if</span>to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;<span class="blue-text">else</span>we execute this block of code;
   	  	    </li>
   	  	    <li>
   	  	    	<a href="">Loops</a>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
   	  	    </li>
   	  	    <li>
   	  	    	<a href="">Function</a>Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instructions manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a tone more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
